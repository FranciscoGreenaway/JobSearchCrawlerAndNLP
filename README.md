# JobSearchCrawlerWithNLP

- IMPORTANT: 
  - Indeed.com html is sometimes randomized for the exact same site. You may need to run the program several times
                before it works completely.
  - This program is just to show my programming ability to add to my resume. I did not create this for commercial use at all.

- Introduction: This is a bot/crawler that takes in a users input to find job results near the user and puts them into a csv file.
                Then, using the links found with in the results, simple Natural Language Processing is done to find 
                the most common word, two-word, three-word, and four-word combinations.

- Usefulness: This program is useful because the results may show you the most frequent skills, experience, etc stated in the job descriptions.
